   One of the most important features of style sheets is that they specify how a 
document is to be presented on different media: on the screen, on paper, with a 
speech synthesizer, with a braille device, etc.
We have currently two ways to specify media dependencies for style sheets:
 Specify the target medium from a style sheet with the @media or 
@import at-rules.
 Specify the target medium within the document language.
The @media rule
The @media rule specifies the target media types (separated by commas) of a 
set of rules.
